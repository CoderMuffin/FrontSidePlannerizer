      <p>This is a playground where you can test different front, side and plans of shapes to see what 3D model they produce. Click on the grids to the right to start colouring in the perspective, and click and drag on the black box to orbit around your shape.</p>
      <p>The simulation is built in such a way that a cube will only be shown in the result if it is shown on all faces. If the result is not as you expected, try checking there are no unmatched squares.</p>
